- Should we filter out the risk if it is 0.01?
- Or should we only filter out if it is 0.0?
- How should we sort the patients on the aggregate view? By room #? By the number of adverse risks that they currently have?

- Function that select the ranges and based on the range
- Patient name background
- Boxes with uncertainty band
- Connect uncertainty with the frontend
- What is missing from my experience
